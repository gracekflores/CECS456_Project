# CECS456_Project
Final project for CECS 456 Machine Learning, Fall 2025

**PLEASE NOTE**, To download the dataset and run the code, you must insert your Kaggle API key (in the form of a .json file) 

I coded a saving mechanism for the trained model, but the one that I used for the project was lost when the Google Colab runtime disconnected. That segment of the code has been commented out, but can be used to save the results of new training session.
